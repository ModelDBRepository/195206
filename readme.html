<p>This is the readme for the C++ computer code associated with the paper:

<p>Hutt et al. (2016) Dynamic Control of Synchronous Activity in Networks
of Spiking Neurons PLOS ONE

<p>These files were contributed by Jeremie Lefebvre.

Example use:<br/>
------------<p/>
You can compile for example with g++ on a mac:<p/>
g++ Periodic\ Forcing.cpp
<p/>and the run with a command like<p/>
./a.out
<p/>
After a short time data files are produced which you could graph for example in matlab:<p/>
<pre>
b=load('SS  -  PSD.txt');
figure
plot(b(:,1),b(:,2))
hold on; plot(b(:,1),b(:,3))
</pre>
<p/>
Which produces a figure<p/>
<img src="./periodic_input_psd.png" alt="screenshot">
<p/>similar to figure 1 D in the paper.
